-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

To be able to start version control (and commit your versions) you will have to initialize the repository. 

- How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory is the entire directory your working on. The repository works only on the files added to the stage.
