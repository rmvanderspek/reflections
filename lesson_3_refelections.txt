-When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When several people are working on the same repository; when you are working on the same repository from several computers; when you want your repository to be public.
-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You may have done commits you don't want published yet. 
-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of the other?
A fork is a clone made on the GitHub: it will have a reference to the original. A clone is a copy to your local work station, without any reference to the original. A branch is a different commit path. 
-What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You'd be able to check wether changes have been made since your last visit to the github repository.
-How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Via email or some kind of data carrier. It would off course be more difficult. Especially once you are trying to work on one and the same file. (Merging would be costly.)
